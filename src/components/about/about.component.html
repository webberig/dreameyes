    Around 2000, a band called "Desperados" was formed by singer-songwriter Marc and lyricist Michel.
    Mathieu joined the band as a drummer and when Sven took on the lead vocals the band was renamed "More". After
    a few gigs and some member changes, the band came to a halt and they went their own ways.

    However, "More" music kept playing in their hearts and eventually - over 20 years later -
    Sven and Marc decided to get back together and record the music from before. Mathieu joined them
    without hesitation.

    This is how "Dream Eyes" was born.
