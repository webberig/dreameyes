    Around 2000, a band called "Desperados" was formed by singer-songwriter Marc and lyricist Michel on bass.
    Mathieu joined the band as a drummer and when Sven took on the lead vocals the band was renamed "More". Only after
    a few years and some member changes, the band came to a halt and they went their own ways.

    However, "More" music kept playing in their hearts and eventually - over 20 years later -
    Sven and Marc decided to get back together and record the music from before. Mathieu did not
    hesitate and joined them.

    This is how "Dream Eyes" was born.
